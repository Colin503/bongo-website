                <h2>The Search for His Tribe</h2>
                <p>Bongo lived in a jungle with his tribe of monkeys. One day, poachers attacked, and his tribe disappeared. Alone and heartbroken, Bongo decided to search for them. For years, he explored mountains, deserts, and rivers, but without success. One night, as he gazed at the stars, he wondered if his tribe could be somewhere out thereâ€”in space. Determined, he found an old rocket and repaired it to begin his journey.</p>

                <h2>A New Story</h2>
                <p>On the Moon, he found no one, but his attention was drawn to a strange planet in the distance. Intrigued, he set off to explore it. The planet was adorned with glowing trees and populated by peculiar creatures. As he wandered, Bongo stumbled upon traces of his tribe. At last, he discovered them gathered in a clearing. Though their shimmering fur made them appear different, he instantly recognized them. His tribe shared how they had been brought to this planet for their protection. Overjoyed by the reunion, Bongo chose to stay with them, though his dreams of exploring the stars never faded.</p>
